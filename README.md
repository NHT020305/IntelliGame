## Motivation
In our country Vietnam, "Road to Mount Olympia" (RtMO) is a top-rated game show tailored for high school students. Established in 1999 by VTV - Vietnam Television, the national broadcaster of Vietnam, it offers an annual opportunity for 144 Grade 11 contestants to demonstrate their knowledge to millions of viewers nationwide. The grand prize for the highest winner every year is a full-ride scholarship to Swinburne University of Technology and 50,000 USD for living expenses. We have always been big fans of this TV program and dreamt of participating as contestants. Unfortunately, despite our tireless efforts to prepare ourselves, due to several circumstances, our dream never came true. Nevertheless, we do not give up; now as bachelor students, with the spirit of "sharing is caring," we have decided to develop a website that simulates RtMO's format. Through this initiative, we aim to assist future generations in realizing their ambitions of taking part in such a prestigious show, leveraging our skills to contribute to their success partly.

 
## Aim
We would like to provide a platform that emulates RtMO's format for students, facilitating participation for groups of four or more in emulator matches which imitates the experience of competing on the actual show.

 
## User Stories
As a Player, I can enter emulated contests (organized by Technicians) only with the contest code and a password to join them quickly.

As a Player, I can interact with the contest interface using keyboard and mouse inputs to send the answer or press the button to get the right to answer the questions.

As a Technician, I can create an account for myself, so I can access my question banks and initiate matches without affecting others.

As a Technician, I can create question banks and manage technical tasks during a contest (e.g., selecting questions, managing the countdown timer, etc.).

As an MC, I can enter contests only with a special password given by the Technician, so I can join them quickly.

As an MC, I can read questions from the screen without taking any action, allowing me to focus on interacting verbally with Players.

As an MC, I can also serve as a technician in some online contests to utilize human resources.
